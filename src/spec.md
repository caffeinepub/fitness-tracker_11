# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Stabilize and debug the fitness app to ensure successful deployment and core functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove any broken or incomplete features causing deployment failures
- Verify workout logging, exercise library, and workout history are working correctly
- Ensure Internet Identity authentication properly protects all workout features
- Test and fix any errors preventing successful app deployment

**User-visible outcome:** Users can reliably log in, log workouts with exercises/sets/reps/weight, browse the exercise library, view workout history, and see accurate statistics on their dashboard without encountering errors.
