  "summary": "The diff partially implements requirements REQ-8, REQ-9, and REQ-10, but is missing the complete implementation of REQ-7 (rest timer). Some hallucinated features exist around workout plan selection UI and dashboard statistics that were not explicitly requested.",

      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Add a rest timer feature that allows users to set and track rest periods of 1-2 minutes between sets during workout logging",
